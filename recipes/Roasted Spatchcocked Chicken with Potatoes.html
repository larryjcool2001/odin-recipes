<p>This is a Description of the Roasted Spatchcocked chicken with potatoes</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing better than a perfectly roasted chicken. Wouldn't you agree? Perfect juicy meat and crunchy skin... Thanks to my father and his visit this past weekend, I have learned a new method for roasting a hen -- spatchcocking!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 serving cooking spray (Optional)</li>
    <li>2 sweet potatoes, sliced very thinly</li>
    <li>2 Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced</li>
    <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
    <li>1 (2 to 3 pound) roasted chicken</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the top and bottom of a broiler pan with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Layer sweet potatoes, potatoes, and onion slices in the bottom of the broiler pan.</li>
    <li>Place chicken, breast side down, on a work surface. Cut along both sides of the backbone with kitchen shears from top to bottom; remove backbone. Flip chicken and splay it open. Press firmly onto breasts with your hands to break the breast-bone.</li>
    <li>Brush olive oil over chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Place on the broiler pan top.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Let cool before slicing, about 10 minutes. Serve with potato and onion mixture.</li>
